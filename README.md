# Tic-Tac-Toe with Minimax AI

## Overview

This project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game with a graphical user interface using Python and Tkinter. It features both single-player and multiplayer modes. In single-player mode, the computer opponent uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.

## Features

- Graphical user interface built with Tkinter
- Single-player mode with AI opponent
- Multiplayer mode for two human players
- Dynamic board updates
- Win and draw detection
- Game restart functionality
- Mode selection (Single-player/Multiplayer)

## Technical Details

- Language: Python
- GUI Library: Tkinter
- AI Algorithm: Minimax

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script to launch the game.
2. Select the game mode (Single-player or Multiplayer).
3. Click on the grid to place your mark (X or O).
4. In single-player mode, compete against the AI.
5. The game announces the winner or a draw.
6. Use the "Restart Game" button to play again.

## Code Structure

- `root` and frames setup for GUI
- Game board representation
- Mode selection functions
- Board update function
- Win and draw check functions
- Minimax algorithm implementation
- Computer player function
- Main game logic in the `play` function
- GUI element creation (buttons, labels)

## Research Background

This implementation is based on research into optimal strategy formulation for Tic-Tac-Toe using the Minimax algorithm. The project aims to create an interactive gaming experience while demonstrating the application of game theory and artificial intelligence in a classic game setting.

## Future Improvements

- Expand to larger grid sizes (e.g., 4x4)
- Implement difficulty levels for AI
- Add score tracking
- Incorporate move suggestions for players

## Contributions

Contributions to improve the game or extend its features are welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
